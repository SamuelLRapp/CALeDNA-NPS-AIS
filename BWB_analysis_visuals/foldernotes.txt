This directory holds the csv file that ran through the NCBI coverage matrix under the following paramters: ncbi_SPP_GENUS_comma_sep_list_with_checking_spelling_synonms. It was the species genus GNR resolve output from Taxize_clean.R, with checking for spelling synonyms and [ORGN] on, and [GENE] off

1. Summary data for each barcode searched 
2. Venn diagrams to see where there is overlap in organism hits
