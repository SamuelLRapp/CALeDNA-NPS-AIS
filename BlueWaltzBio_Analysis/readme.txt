1. BWB_analysis_visuals is may come back for some interesting comparisons of barcode specific information later
2. comparing_NCBIvsCRUX: mostly empty code
3. Functions: has functions for manipulating code...could probably just move it up a directory because it holds the function for creating the taxonomic ranks also
4. Which_org_have_no_references. This folder has code for many functions which combine to create summary data tables for any output for RSB NCBI or CRUX. Super useful set of functions that can be implemented into the actual tool in the future
5. comparing_org_w_primers_to_BWB_output: mostly empty code. I could use the input dataset with info about organisms with primers and just run it on bwb on its own.
6. input_ie_RefSeq_output: just datasets from RSB that these folders use as data.
